##Build instructions

To build the project’s code you will need :

- [JDK (6.x+)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
You can install it on Ubuntu with:

    [sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk](apt://openjdk-6-jdk)
- [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) (built-in in Netbeans).
You can install it on Ubuntu with:

    [sudo apt-get install ant](apt://ant)
- [Antlr 3.2](http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.2.jar) (*)
- [JOpt Simple](http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net/) (*)

(*) If you have an active internet connection antlr and jopt-simple will be downloaded automatically to the correct directory during the first build, otherwise you have to copy antlr-3.2.jar and jopt-simple-3.2.jar to glossa-interpreter/lib/


Open a terminal and give:
    ./build.sh

##How to run the interpreter

To run the interpreter you must have a JRE (6.x+) installed. Then you can give:

    ./glossa-interpreter <input_file>

e.g.:

    ./glossa-interpreter src/glossa/samples/PrintTest.gls

For more information give:

    ./glossa-interpreter glossa.Main -h

##Samples

There are some example input files in:

    src/glossa/samples/

The project is developed using [Netbeans 6.8](http://netbeans.org/).
